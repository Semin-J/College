1) Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before doing anything else?
-> Especially while using dynamic allocation, when the object deallocate certain memory inside, the object is not valid anymore.
Or when we use pointer, two objects are pointed by a same pointer or reference, it doesn't know which object is pointed or valid.

2) List examples of how you avoided code duplication.
-> Made != operator, checking two object is same or not. This operatore was used to prevent self-assignment

3) List what you have learned in completing this workshop.
-> How to make copy constructor and deep copying = operator.
Always have to handle implicit error such as self-assignment.
