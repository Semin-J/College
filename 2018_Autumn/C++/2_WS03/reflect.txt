1) How many elements are there in each C-style character string that stores a family or given name
for the account? Why?
- 41 includes null terminator. 40 is for real characters(elements of name) + 1 is for '\0' 


2) Your class declares two member functions named set(...).  In C, this would generate an error. 
Name the feature of C++ that allows this.
- Function Overloading in C++. C++ compiler check not only the name of function,
but also the type of parameters.


3) What have you learned in completing this workshop?
- How to do Casting string to integer, integer to string. Also could know atoi() and itoa()
for casting are old and not standard function. so I used to_string() and just each character-48
by ascii code for character to integer.


Quiz 2 Reflection
3. Write down a piece of C++ code that a) allocates memory, b) stores the string "OOP244"
and deallocates the memory storage.

char* mem = new char [7];
-->strcpy(mem, "OOP244");
delete[] mem;
mem = nullptr;
return 0;

-Reason: I assigned to empty string ' mem = "OOP244" ' like this.
	However, to assign the string after the declaration, need to use strcpy function.
