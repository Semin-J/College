1. The operator+ returns a Fraction object. Explain why this operator should not return a reference to a Fraction object.
- Because the result of addition doesn't affect to real object's data members.
On the other hand, operator += return a reference of Fraction object, because the result of the += addition affect to real object's data members.

2. List the temporary objects in the w5_at_home.cpp main module.
- (a+b), (b+d). They weren't assigned to any other objects.

3. List the simplifications that you made to your class to minimize code du-plication.
- void safe_set(); -> to set data members in safe empty state.

4. Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
- How to deal with overloading of member operators. Furthermore, now get used to use
this keyword and making class and dealing with data members freely.

Quiz 4&5 Reflection
4-3. What is the purpose of a constructor?
- Initialize data members of an object safely.

5-1. What is the difference between a helper function and a member function?
- Helper function has information from public member functions of the class, so it doesn't require access to the private data members.
